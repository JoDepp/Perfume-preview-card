### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped to reinforce the HTML and CSS I have learned. I learned more about ways to get images on the site. I struggled with that and still am not satisfied with how the images turned out. I need to mess with it more, but I'm ready to move on. 

### Continued development

I'll continue to practice CSS and espeically getting images to fit.
